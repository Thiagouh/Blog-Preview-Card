## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

My biggest learning during the process of creating the challenge was understanding how to use Tailwind. When using it, I understood how easily it can allow me to style my challenge. In fact, it allowed me to overcome the biggest difficulty I had, which was using the media query correctly.

### Continued development

I intend to continue solving challenges to develop and improve my skills and learn to use new things. I will continue using Tailwind so I can explore and use it correctly, and I will integrate libraries and frameworks in future challenges.
